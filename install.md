## 1. Text editor

Install a programmer's text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/)

* On OS X, Atom requires OS X version 10.8 or later â€“ if you have an OS X version 10.6 or 10.7, try [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) instead. If you have OS X 10.5 or earlier, ask help from a coach.
  * Instructions on how to check your OS X version: [Check About this Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260)
