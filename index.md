This tutorial will teach the basics of making web pages. We will proceed in small steps, so that it would be possible to understand what is being done every step of the way. We don't like magic.

The things which are taught later require understanding of what came before, so take your time and experiment by changing things to get a feel for how they work. There will be screenshots of what you can expect to see and example solutions to copy in case you get stuck.

Before starting, you will need to install some tools. Please go through the [installation guide](/install/) first.
